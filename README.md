# neural-experiments
Loose-leaf notebook of experiments with neural networks.

## Experiments
### LSTM
 * lstm_calc.py A LSTM network that learns to evaluate simple computations in RPN.
  * lstm_notmnist_classifier.py A LSTM network that learns to classify notMNIST data. You need to create the pickle file notMNIST.pickle first. This can be done by the notebook https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/examples/udacity/1_notmnist.ipynb
